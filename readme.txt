== Description ==

Succeeding the popularity of Zurb's Foundation framework, Foundation Tables is a plugin written to harness the responsiveness the framework provides, and extend the WordPress page editor with a new toolset to easily insert, edit, and delete collections of tabular data.
If you're using a Foundation Theme, and are looking for a method to rapidly and responsively insert tabled data, this is the plugin for your site.

**One, Two, Three, Four Columns**

WordPress makes editing page content a snap. Even the rich-text editor's table tools are pretty good.
But if you're using a FOUNDATION theme, wouldn't it be killer to take advantage of the responsive styles pioneered by Zurb?
This plugin, FoundationTables integrates these row/column/pad classes to greatly cut down on your need for rewriting table styles and responsive media queries.

* Add as many tables to your page as needed
* Select a column width (1/12 = x-small, 2/12 = small, 3/12 = medium, 4/12 = wide, 6/12 = x-wide)
* Select one of the pre-styled themes (currently: Grey w/ Header, Grey w/ First Column Highlighted, Simple Grey), or style your own using independent stylesheets for your tables
* Click into a table cell for an enlarged HTML-friendly editor window
* Add new rows to a table (or new tables to a page) with the click of a button
* Omit columns (currently: maximum 6), by leaving them empty
* Insert the tables into your page content using a FoundationTable insert button built right into your RTE, or compact shortcodes ( <div class="foundtabinsert" id="foundtab_2"></div> )
* Preview the table's position in your content without the hindrance of all of in-line markup tabular data requires
